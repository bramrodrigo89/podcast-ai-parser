In today's show, we're going to be breaking down the latest technical analysis, as well as Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy and Bitcoin. Three years after, now at 153,000 BTC on their balance sheet, we'll also be discussing Bitcoin's secondary scare now playing out. Warren's top analyst, Benjamin Cohen. But how low will the Bitcoin price plunge? We're going to be discussing that, as well as one catalyst which can trigger the Bitcoin price to explode by more than 450 percent, predicts fund strats. Tom Lee will also be discussing rich dad Robert Kiyosaki predicting Bitcoin rising to a million dollars per coin and gold hitting 75,000 while silver hits 60,000 if the world economy crashes. We'll also be discussing Cathie Wood confirming her one and a half million dollar Bitcoin price forecast for the King Crypto. We'll also be taking a look at the overall crypto market, all this plus so much more in today's show. I'm your fearless host, JV, and today is Stacking Saturday. It's August 19th, 2023. Let's kick it off with our market watch as we do each and every day. We got Bitcoin still in the red, unfortunately, but maintaining that 26,000 support. We have Ether and many of the alts back in the green, but barely after one of the biggest bloodbaths we have experienced in several months. We have Ether maintaining 1,600 and checking out CoinMarketCap.com, the current crypto market cap sits just above one trillion. So the entire crypto market cap right now is only a trillion dollars. Isn't that insanity? Now, there's 26 billion in volume in the past 24 hours with the Bitcoin dominance currently at 48.1 percent, with the Ether dominance at 19 percent even. And checking out the top 100 crypto gainers in the past 24 hours. We have SUI up about 16 percent trading at 55 and a half cents, followed by Hedera, HBAR up 11 and a half percent trading at six and a half cents, followed by AKT up 11 percent trading at a dollar 55. And checking out the top 100 crypto gainers for the past week. Finally, we have many of the alts back in the green, but we have to keep in mind the massive bloodbath with over a billion dollars worth of liquidations practically in the past 48 hours. So naturally, a lot of these alt coins are bouncing back after 20, 30 percent losses. And checking out the crypto greed and fear index, we're currently rated a 39 still in fear. We were in fear yesterday at a 37. Last week was a 54 neutral and last month a 56 in greed. So there you have it. How many of you have taken advantage of this recent dip? Please do let me know. BTD and Stakinem Sats, dollar cost averaging is the name of the game, especially if you're in this for the long haul. And also want to ask you where my long term hotlters at. Make some noise in that live chat. Now we're going to do our technical analysis a little bit different today. Why not try something new? And yes, I got some color to my skin because I spent the day at the pool here in Puerto Rico yesterday with my daughter. And it feels good. Soak it in those sun rays. Free vitamin D, D3. Why not take advantage of it? But anyways, now let's break down our technical analysis. I'm using TradingView today. You should be able to see this on your screen. Let me know in the comments. I'm so sorry, ma'am. I know you need this medicine, but it looks like it's not covered by your insurance. Yeah, unfortunately, I had to deny that one. Wait, who are you? I'm your insurance company's pharmacy benefit manager. I get paid based on the price of a medicine and I don't make as much money off this one. No one should stand between you and your medicine.

And you're going to check out these oscillators right here. It says bi and then you have the moving averages is a strong cell signal. You're going to see why here in a moment. Let's start with the oscillators, which you should be able to see on the left on your screen right now. Relative strength index we commonly cover, which is the RSI, is a bi signal. The commodity channel index is a bi signal. The momentum indicator is a bi signal. The MACD is a cell signal. The Williams percentage range is a bi signal. We got some neutral signals, but let's check out these moving averages. Check it out. Cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, everything virtually says cell for moving averages, except the whole moving average. And I'm not even familiar personally with that metric, but all the major ones, the exponential, the simple moving average, et cetera, all in the cell zone. So very interesting to say the least, but I want to know how many of you took advantage of this dip. Or are you expecting and anticipating the Bitcoin price to drop even lower? And if you're one of those expecting a lower drop, how low will the Bitcoin price likely go? Let me know your honest thoughts in the comments right down below. With that being shared, now let's break down the latest with Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy, because it was exactly three years ago today he got his infamous Bitcoin position. And now today they hold over 153,000 BTC on their balance sheet, which is no joke. Some say when Bitcoin hits new highs, Michael Saylor is going to be amongst the richest persons in this world. That wouldn't surprise me whatsoever, especially with his attitude of there is no second best and continuing to accumulate Bitcoin and never selling, he said, for hundreds and hundreds of years to come. So we shall see how that plays out. All I know is Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy is the smart money. Kathy Wood is the smart money. And I like watching the smart money and not listening necessarily to what they say. But more importantly, always watching what they do. I'm watching you. You know what I mean? Anyways, fam, let's break it down. MicroStrategy's co-founder and executive chair, Saylor, who served as the company's former CEO for over 30 years, continues to remain bullish on Bitcoin. Three years after his publicly traded business intelligence company decided to make its first Bitcoin purchase. That's right. If you missed the memo, Michael Saylor, his company, MicroStrategy, was the first publicly traded company to put Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Saylor also made a big price prediction for the asset, believing it could exceed a million dollars per coin. I say that's conservative because I've covered Michael Saylor predictions here on the show of him talking about a 14 million dollar Bitcoin price. Real talk. Now, MicroStrategy made history in headlines. It was August 11th, 2020, virtually three years ago, after becoming the first publicly traded company to purchase Bitcoin. The firm initially hinted back in July of 2020 about its plans to invest in assets such as Bitcoin or gold rather than holding cash as a way to escape inflation. With the company later deciding to buy Bitcoin worth a quarter billion, 250 million, and adopting it as a primary treasury reserve asset. And how many of you remember the infamous quote where he compared keeping cash on the balance sheet as a melting ice cube? I'll never forget that personally. And according to Saylor at that time, who was MicroStrategy's CEO, the decision to go for Bitcoin was made because of the crypto served as a better hedge against inflation and had a higher return on investment compared with other assets. Facts. Now, that purchase marked the beginning of several investments amid the crypto's volatile price movements, causing the company to hold a large Bitcoin stash. And in June of 2023, Saylor announced that the business intelligence giant bought 12,333 more Bitcoin for three hundred and forty seven million dollars, making it one of the company's largest purchases in a single quarter since second quarter of 2021. You might not realize it, but life has a soundtrack. For most of us, it sounds a bit like. But you can always change the station. In hundreds of Delta Airlines destinations, you can turn your soundtrack into a global chorus. Delta, keep climbing. And as of July 31st of this year, MicroStrategy officially holds one hundred and fifty two thousand eight hundred BTC, which the company said was purchased for roughly four and a half billion dollars at an average price of twenty nine thousand six hundred and seventy two bucks per BTC. Now, the business intelligence software firm is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Besides corporate holders, we have the great scale Bitcoin trust and they literally control over four hundred thousand BTC. Just FYI. Meanwhile, in a December twenty twenty two SEC filing, MicroStrategy revealed that sold seven hundred and four Bitcoin to generate tax benefits. The sale was a first for the company with the action contrary to the previous statement by Saylor, who said that MicroStrategy would never sell any of its stash. Now, Saylor is known as one of the biggest Bitcoin supporters and has continued to promote the asset as far superior to gold, which is fact calling a digital gold. However, he has not always not been pro Bitcoin. I mean, there was a time it was actually against it. There's an infamous tweet dating back to 2013 stating it would suffer the same fate as online gambling. Meanwhile, online gambling seems to be soaring and thriving better than ever before. And the same thing with Bitcoin. Go figure. Even not a rocket scientist can be right every single time. But Saylor's view on Bitcoin has since changed. And you got to respect he had the balls to change his opinion publicly. How many people like Peter Schiff refused to ever change their opinion, regardless of how wrong they clearly are. You know what I mean? Now, the MicroStrategy executive chair in May of twenty twenty two said the Bitcoin price can go into the millions per coin while stating it is the future of money. We know this is a fact. The following month, Saylor predicted Bitcoin price would skyrocket to a million dollars. And later in September of twenty twenty two, the exec said the crypto could be valued at five hundred thousand in the next 10 years if it matches the market cap of gold. And for context, Bitcoin's market cap is currently roughly five hundred seventy billion, while gold is currently estimated to be twelve point eight trillion dollars. Now, also, Saylor seemed to be unfazed by the ongoing enforcement crackdown on the crypto sector by the SEC, stating the regulator's actions could benefit Bitcoin by boosting the assets price and increasing its market dominance share to 80 percent. Could you imagine Bitcoin continuing to eat these alt coins kind of like Miss Pac-Man? You know, I mean, I think it's likely to happen just a matter of time. And Saylor, who served as the CEO of MicroStrategy for 30 years, left his position in August to become the company's executive officer, with MicroStrategy president Fong Li serving as the CEO. The American business exec explained that his new role will help him better focus on the firm's Bitcoin acquisition strategy and related Bitcoin advocacy initiatives. So there you have it. The man just wants to focus on stacking more sets. You can't blame him. Much power and respect to him. Shout out to Michael Saylor. If he is one of your favorite Bitcoiners, do let me know. And what's one of your favorite Saylor speeches? One of mine is there is no second best. There's Bitcoin and you got Bitcoin. Shout out to Saylor. Anyways, fam, now let's cover our next story of the day and discuss when do you feel the bottom will be in for Bitcoin? Do you think the bottom is already in at 15.7 or you think we have lower to go? Let's see what some of the top analysts have to say. This is Benjamin Cohen. Cohen tells his 800000 YouTube subs the current crypto downturn is in line with a pattern that occurs every four years, quoting him here. The idea behind the secondary scare in crypto comes from the fact the S&P 500 tends to get a correction in August for September of its U.S. pre-election year. As we know, we have a big presidential election in the U.S. next year, along with that having. So if we were to look at the 2023, you can see the S&P is in fact getting this correction, which we talked about. The S&P 500 is down a little over five percent since the start of this month. And according to the widely followed strategist, Bitcoin has plummeted by between thirty nine and eighty three percent. During the previous secondary scares.

It's breakfast bliss with whole grain energy that the whole family can enjoy with a delicious satisfying crunch in every bite and that extra sweetness of cinnamon. A little crunch goes a long way. To learn more and shop for Cheerios O'Crunch, visit Cheerios dot com. Twenty four grams to 30 grams whole grain per serving, at least 48 grams recommended daily. Putting him here in twenty nineteen, once the secondary scare got underway, once we got below the twenty week moving average, right? Or the weekly candle that let us below it. Bitcoin dropped yet another 61 percent. This one, twenty fifteen, was about a 40 or 39 percent drop. Then in 2011, you had an eighty two and a half percent drop before we actually finally bottomed out in the secondary scare. In all three cases in the pre-having year, the S&P dropped in quarter three of the pre-election year and then Bitcoin entered into a downtrend for a while. And we have three examples, one where we went down about 80 percent, one where we went down about 40 percent and one we went down about 60 percent. So on how long Bitcoin could fall going by historical precedent, Cohen outlines three scenarios, quoting him again, If it's a 40 percent drop similar to 2015, 40 percent drop puts Bitcoin at 17,500. OK, that would be the lowest. This would basically correspond to his 2015 move that would put Bitcoin at 17,500 dollars. A 61 percent drop, which is what we experienced in 2019, would put it at around 11,400 and an 80 percent drop would put it much lower, which I will say I don't think it is going to go nearly that low. And to watch this video he did entitled Bitcoin, The Secondary Scare Has Begun, check the show notes below the video in the description. And what are your thoughts? Do you agree or disagree with the analysts? My personal thoughts, the lows are already in. They were in a long time ago. At the end of last year, we hit that 15,700 level. I personally am very skeptical that we'll ever see a sub 20,000 dollar Bitcoin price ever again. But I could be wrong in the same token. That's my personal opinion. Is that OK? I'm just telling you how I really feel. I think it's a great discount to take advantage of buying Bitcoin right now, considering the all time high in November of 2021 was roughly 69,000. So you tell me the math. Where are we at? Like a 60, 70 percent discount from the top? Not too shabby. I would be stacking stats like there is no tomorrow versus, oh, let's sell my entire Bitcoin stash and buy it back at 15,000. What if you're wrong? We don't go sub 20,000 and you lose out on a massive position. That could happen as well. I don't like gambling. I'm in this for the long haul. And there's nothing like the real thing, baby. And that's the fastest horse in the race. That's the king crypto. We call it BTC. And with that being a shared fam, now let's discuss an 180,000 dollar Bitcoin price prediction by the one and only Tom Lee of FunStrat. FunStrat global advisors managing partner Tom Lee says one of the catalysts which can spur the Bitcoin price to hit. Six figures is going to be that Bitcoin ETF approval. Let's break down this Bitcoin ETF because that's what everyone is talking about right now. Right. Quoting him here from this interview, he says, if the spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of Bitcoin. And so the clearing price, this is done by Sean Farrell, who is our crypto digital strategist, is over one hundred and fifty thousand. It could even be like one hundred and eighty thousand dollars per coin. A spot US because a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved outside of the US. When they asked him, do you think there will be a spot Bitcoin ETF? And with Bitcoin currently trading at what? Roughly twenty six thousand. That means he's predicting an appreciation between four hundred and sixty seven percent and five hundred and eighty percent. Let's go send it now on Bitcoin's likely price action. If a spot Bitcoin ETF fails to win approval in the US, Lee shares the following. There are still upside because of the halving next year. Yes. So you have a drop in supply again. So the clearing price has to increase, but it won't be six figures. So he's ultimately saying if we don't get the ETF approval, we can still go to six figures eventually, but not as soon as we would anticipate with the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. So according to the Bitcoin bull, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy going forward will impact crypto assets. Quitting him again from this interview, crypto is dependent on monetary policy. So if inflation is cooling, then we can start to bet on forward financial conditions, easing and the central bank easing sooner. That's bullish for crypto as well as alternative assets. And to watch this video he did on this interview, inflation is on the glide path towards sub two percent by the middle. Check the show notes below the video in the description. Let me know if you agree or disagree with Tom Lee virtually predicting that the Bitcoin price will likely see one hundred and fifty and one hundred and eighty thousand per coin between that range coming up here in the near future.

And again, I'm going to read everyone's comments out loud. So please let me know where you're from and any comments or questions address them right now in the live chat. Now let's discuss Robert Kiyosaki, the famous Rich Dad Poor Dad author and his one million dollar Bitcoin price prediction, followed by the one and only Kathy Wood of ARK Invest with her doubling down on her one and a half million dollar price prediction and how she got to those numbers, you know, dates, et cetera, and everything that comes along with it. And then we'll dive into our live Q&A. Massive shout out to Kiyosaki. Rich Dad Poor Dad was a very influential book in my young adulthood, which absolutely impacted me in a positive way. So give kudos and flowers when they are due. Now, in a tweet on Monday, Kiyosaki explained that while he expects the price of Bitcoin to reach one hundred thousand dollars per coin in the near term, he believes that it can soar to a million dollars while gold will rise to seventy five thousand. I take it he means an ounce and silver trade at sixty thousand an ounce if the world's economy crashes, noting he has been saying for years that gold and silver are God's money while Bitcoin is people's money. And he also wrote the following bad news if stocks and bond markets crash, gold and silver skyrocket. Worst news, if the world economy crashes, Bitcoin will rise to a million dollars, gold to seventy five thou and silver to sixty thousand. Now, would you consider this bad news if the markets crashed and Bitcoin skyrocketed to a million dollars? That'd be the best news of my life. Besides the birth of my daughter. Just saying. He added that savers who hold the U.S. dollar will be called fake money. They'll be in serious trouble, noting that the U.S. national debt is way too high. Preach Kiyosaki often said that gold, silver and Bitcoin are his preferred investments, emphasizing they are the best for unstable times. And following his warning about the global recession, he cautioned in May the world economy is on the verge of a collapse. The renowned author predicted in February the price of Bitcoin would hit five hundred thousand per coin by 2025, the year proceeding to having. And while gold will soar to five thousand and silver will hit five hundred bucks during that same time period, he recently started saying that the price of Bitcoin went one hundred thousand this year in 2023 and one hundred and twenty thousand next year in 2024, which is the same prediction made by Standard Chartered Bank. And FYI, guess who is the primary shareholder of Standard Chartered Bank? You guess right. It's BlackRock. And did you know that BlackRock owns even a large piece of micro strategy? That's right. So they're already indirectly invested into Bitcoin. Just pointing that out. This week, here's the investors to buy silver before it's gone, noting that it is more affordable than gold. Kiyosaki has been warning that the U.S. economy is headed for a crash landing. He previously said that America is bankrupt and warned of hyperinflation. The rich dad author has been cautioning that a giant crash is coming for quite some time. Many, many years. Moreover, he warned that the U.S. dollar will die as the BRICS nations, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and like 20, 30 plus other nations plan to launch a common currency. And it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out and what currency that they select. Could you imagine if BRICS adopted Bitcoin as their currency? Hmm. Wouldn't that be a game changer? And also, there's other parts of the world right now with hyperinflation occurring in real time. I think Bitcoin is the only savior just as it saved El Salvador. And if you translate El Salvador, it translates to the savior. Go figure. Could it be a coincidence or all by design? Let me know your honest thoughts, fam. And now let's break down our final feature story of the day. That's Kathy Wood of ARK Invest and her prediction of a one and a half million dollar Bitcoin price. Send it and let's go. In a forecast case study released in February. Let me know if you can see the screen. I know the text is a little smaller on this particular article, but let me know in the chat, please. ARK Invest presented three scenarios for the crypto market until 2030. The bearish one suggests Bitcoin will just rise to 260,000. Not too shabby for a bearish scenario. Send it. Let's go. While the bullish one foresees a surge to one and a half million dollars per Bitcoin. And in the interview with Bloomberg this week, Kathy Wood said the team's confidence in the bullish scenario has increased. That's great. She's gaining more confidence. Let's go. And as you can see outlined here, Bitcoin to likely scale into a multi trillion dollar market. You can see the bear case with a 2030 price target, which shows 258,500 in this graph on the left. And then followed by that, the base case by 2030 represents 682,800 Bitcoin. I'd love that personally. I love all these targets. But could you imagine Bitcoin really hitting 1.48 million, virtually 1.5 million by 2030 in a bullish case? I most absolutely can see that happening. Wood believes Bitcoin will continue to establish itself as an insurance option against inflation and that everyone will want it at the end of the day. Cryptos protect wealth from outright confiscation. Great point. Inflation and the risk of loss to third parties when stored or transferred with the adoption of cryptos and the regulatory and legal framework in place. Interest in Bitcoin will grow exponentially. I agree 100 percent. The SEC being flooded with applications right now to launch Bitcoin ETFs clearly indicates the same. ARK Invest teamed up with 21 shares and applied documents ahead of investing giant BlackRock. So they're actually first in line. The SEC has accepted this and other submissions as indicated in public records. A decision is due on 13th of August. But unfortunately, that decision ultimately shared that they were going to push back the decision now until I believe the first quarter of 2024. So sadly, there will be no Bitcoin spot ETF approvals anytime soon this year in 2023. That's the bad news. But some experts agree that BlackRock's participation increases the chances of a positive outcome. Existing crypto funds have already experienced an influx of capital from institutional investors not seen since quarter four of 2021. When we hit that all time high with over 700 million dollars invested into Bitcoin in just four weeks. So there you have it. And also you can see here Bitcoin spiral for your cycle and you can see it shows you the bottoms, the halvings. And this is actually a pretty cool chart in this cycle with a record in 2026 Bitcoin will reach the maximum in the range, which is 100000 to a million. I know that's a very wide margin and kind of the same as stock, the flow model creator Plan B predicting Bitcoin being somewhere between 100 grand and a million dollars after the halving. And in the next cycle, with a peak in 2030, the price will range from one million to 10 million dollars per coin. Well, if you'd like to see a 10 million dollar price action, let's freaking go. Now, it's currently unknown whether the ARK Invest team was guided by the theory of cycles, but potential investors should consider that forecast. Mathematical models give only a conditional idea of further changes. So there you have it, fam. How many of you are in agreement with Cathie Wood of ARK Invest that we likely to see that million dollar Bitcoin price or even above one and a half million by the year 2030, which is roughly seven years out?
