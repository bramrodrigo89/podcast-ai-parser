See mintmobile.com for full terms. A healthy functioning democracy. That'd be pretty cool to have, wouldn't it? Because we are sorely lacking in that particular department right now. Now, one of the pillars of a proper functioning democracy would be a truly independent media which arms citizens with the facts about the world in which they live so they can make informed decisions about the future of their country or indeed their local community, for that matter. It would be about holding the powerful to account without fear or favour. Now, we just don't have that. Sorry guys to be brutal about it, but just not currently on offer. Maybe we'll be lucky. Christmas this year, Santa will deliver us with a truly independent media. Now, let's just hear from Hugh Grant. He was, of course, a celebrated British actor. He was in the United States on a show and he's been an active campaign on media issues for a long time. I think he had some important things to say. Newspapers need power, a lot of power, because they're really important to democracy. But, he said pompously, with power comes responsibility. In Britain, it is a kind of uniquely UK problem. There's no responsibility. These big newspaper owners, largely non-taxpaying newspaper owners, are living above the law and invading the privacy of people whose kids have been killed in a road accident or whatever to get the sensational article. No one dares to take them on in Britain because they're so scared of them, especially the politicians. And that's why politicians really, in my country, are chosen by the press. Our prime minister is largely chosen by dint of how much he's sucked up to the newspaper barons. So that's what my campaign is about. Do you think that Brexit has ruined your country? Well, I do. He said with a smile. And actually, now the majority of Brits do as well, I think. So maybe it'll get fixed. Yeah, the Europeans may not want us back. They may say, well, you know, choose one and stick to it. It's also very pricey for them to get back into. Yeah, but they need to. He used to have a discount. True. Yeah. I think we've lost our discount. Points were made by Hugh there. I think it's fair to say. It's a bit over-familiar, using his first name. But, I don't know. I feel like Hugh Grant's been a very big part of our lives. So it kind of feels like we've got to know him. And he's got, I think, some intelligent things to say. I don't always agree with him. I'm not sure he's a radical lefty socialist, for a start. But he has raised some really, really important issues about the media in his campaigning. Now, he's right, incidentally, that the right-wing media basically behave like gangsters. Anyone seeing as a threat to their political or commercial objectives or tries to stand up to them in any way risks getting trashed, demonized, or indeed their lives being turned over. That's whether they're celebrities or they're politicians. Now, people go, well, come on now, Owen. We've got a free press. They do what they want. They're not run by the government. And that's true. We're not North Korea. Not an ambitious place to start. I often say that, but it's true. I mean, it's just, you know, this idea of the definition of a free press is as long as the government don't directly run the media. You know, I think it's such a low bar. Because in practice, media outlets in Britain and elsewhere are playthings of this tiny group of often very wealthy, extremely wealthy oligarchs. Rupert Murdoch is the obvious one, but I don't know, Michael Bloomberg or now the late Silvio Berlusconi who ended up as Prime Minister of Italy whilst running much of the media in the country. The Barclay brothers, for example. Now, in the US alone, just eight media corporations own 788 TV stations. And obviously owning kind of having such a near monopoly or such a large stranglehold over the means of information. That is a way of buying and gaining political influence. And actually it's interesting because owning a newsroom does get direct access to politicians. Between 1988 and 2012, Murdoch met with senior politicians in Britain at least 113 times. Even after the phone hacking scandal, so in one nine month period alone, Murdoch met ministers or advisers at least 22 times. When Trump was president, Murdoch was ringing him once a week. It's ridiculous. Now, obviously these are rich people and they want to make money. And they are part of a status quo, which they want to defend. So obviously they've got a vested interest in opposing policies, movements, politicians. Even if they kind of modestly want to challenge the status growth which these oligarchs benefit, you know, in which they thrive. So that's why politicians and movements who challenge it are often just crushed by media outlets. So even when you get ideas and beliefs which are quite widespread in society, I mean, you know, the polling shows that in the US, 57% of self-declared Democrats, tens of millions of Americans have a positive view of socialism. But it's not like you get a load of socialist pundits reflecting those views on US TV channels or as columnists. I mean, you know, in Britain, overwhelming, well, very large majorities of people support nationalization of energy, of rail, of water, higher taxes on the rich. But how many newspapers, how many newspaper columnists are there advocating for those sorts of ideas even though they're so widespread? Now, obviously, just because they're widespread in public opinion doesn't mean newspapers want to give them a platform because they are threatened by those ideas. Of course, that's the whole point. Now, you also, I mean, I'm always interested in this kind of like, how often there's a blurring of lines between those in power and many or all too many senior journalists. I'm not just thinking of like, I have no examples of journalists being like godparents to the children of politicians or going on holiday, well, having sex with each other. But also, I mean, just, you know, you had one example, James Forsythe was the political editor of the Spectator magazine. A weekly columnist for the Times and formerly the Sun in the Mail on Sunday. Best man at his wedding was the now Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was then, who became, well, he was conservative, chastity, shtek, of course, under Boris Johnson. The godparents to each of these kids, his wife Allegra Stratter was a former BBC and ITV journalist, former Guardian columnist, I should say, not Guardian columnist, Guardian reporter. Now, she became the spin doctor for Rishi Sunak and then Boris Johnson before her downfall during the whole political crisis. Her downfall during the whole Partige Saga. He ended up getting a job now as a speechwriter for Rishi Sunak. It's ludicrous. I mean, it's like we talk about the BBC, which I've talked about in length before, where, you know, Boris Johnson, Theresa May, David Cameron and Rishi Sunak have all hired senior BBC figures as their spin doctors. I forgot to mention George Osborne also did that. So, you know, it's that closeness often. And, you know, you can see it in Britain. The editorial stance of most newspapers is very right wing in an aggressive way. They aggressively support the conservative party, particularly in elections. And, you know, use that to try and monster Labour. You know, under Tony Blair, part of the Farsian Pact made with the establishment and to get the support, for example, of Rupert Murdoch, was obviously not threatening the status quo and the establishment, which is what, you know, Tony Blair stuck to his, stuck to that end of the bargain. It's interesting too about the social background of journalists, because in Britain, it's the second most socially exclusive profession after being a doctor. That was a government study that found that. The number of people of colour working in journalism, 8%, compared to 12% of the wider Labour force. Working class representation fell to a record low recently, astonishing 84% of journalists from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, 16% from lower or middle. And then you've got, you know, lack of female representation, particularly as you get to more senior positions. But, you know, one study found a quarter British front page stories in a randomly selected timeframe were written by women, so three quarters by men. There's also, you know, the fact that newspaper advertising revenues in collapse has thrown traditional media outlets into crisis. And that's men with more people wanting to be journalists than ever. That precariousness, but also ambition is exploited by media outlets, because journalists are scared that if they rock the boat, then they'll get fired. And that's the end of their career in the media. And that gives a whip hand to those at the top. I just think it's what, you know, examples of Richard Pepeo, who worked for the Daily Star, who sensationally resigned many years ago, alleging that he was made to peddle anti-Muslim stories based on untruths. And the crisis of the media is making it hard another way. I mean, you know, newspaper employment has fallen steeply. In Britain, 228 local newspapers closed between 2005 and 2018. The number of regional journalists is estimated at half to around 6,500. That stops working class people becoming journalists, because they often get experience on local newspapers and climb the ladder. Unpaid internships is another thing that makes it financially prohibitive, because often journalists get their foot in the door through unpaid internships, often because they're friends or relatives of people who already work in the media. But also, you have to work for free to get that experience on your CV to get into the media. But obviously, most people can't afford to do that, to live for free in London often, or to do expensive postgraduate qualifications in journalism, which most people can't afford to do. But it's interesting, as newspapers, as you get, you know, you get people from gilded backgrounds, as journalists, relatively speaking. But as also the number of journalists declines, PR, public relations, increases. What PR does is manipulate public perceptions and attitudes on behalf of wealthy clients. It's exploded inside. So the financial worth of PR jumps from 2013 from 9.6 billion to 14 billion three years later. And the workforce in that period went from 62,000 to 86,000. You have fewer journalists and fewer PR people who are kind of trying to manipulate public opinion. These are just some examples of how the media is broken, how it is often the plaything of a rich media mogul's, how it's journalists come from disproportionately privileged backgrounds. There's a lack of representation for voices in society who often suffer the worst forms of oppression in society. And they're often scapegoated where you get media outlets punching down, attacking refugees, Muslims, migrants, trans people, telling complete untruths about them. And then when they're forced to do a correction, it's on page 53, right at the bottom so no one can see it when it was on the front page or whatever. And you get the rise of public relations and the decline of the number of journalists. So you get, end up, of copy regurgitating what PR wants you to hear on behalf of wealthy clients. These are some examples. It's not the same as the media. It's not a functioning democracy. So I'm glad to hear Grant has fostering and supporting this debate. And I want to hear more.
